"});index.add({'id':1,'href':'/docs/rpi/overview/','title':"Overview",'section':"RASPI POWER PACK",'content':"This project is currently still under development.\nThe Super Power RPi edition is a battery backup unit for the Raspberry Pi single board computer. It is meant to work with the Raspberry Pi 3 and 4.\nDesign\r#\r\rThe design is based on the bq25895 charger IC and the TPS61088 boost converter IC. It also integrates an STM32F412 microcontroller to provide timing and control independent of the Raspberry Pi.\nThe bq25895 provides some specific benefits for this project. It has a low series resistance in it\u0026rsquo;s FET, so the resistance between the battery and the boost converter is quite low. It also automatically negotiates higher power USB charging. Finally, it has significant internal monitoring, which eliminates the need for external components such as an ADC.\nThe STM32F412 was selected as it has quite a few internal peripherals to choose from. It also has a built in RTC, which allows for maintaining time even between power cycles.\nIn addition to the STM32, the footprint for an ATTiny85 was provided, but not populated, such that if anyone wants to use that series of MCU, they are able.\nPhysical Form Factor\r#\r\rThe Super Power RPi takes the shape of a Pi HAT PCB. It is designed to be used as either a traditional HAT, or in an underslung configuration.\nThe traditional HAT makes electrical connections using the 40-pin header and it is secured using the mounting holes at the 4 corners.\nThe underslung configuration also uses the mounting holes, but makes the electrical connections using pogo-pins. The pogo-pins connect to the 5V, GND, and I2C pins. The standoffs to be used are ____mm tall.\nUse Cases\r#\r\rGenerally speaking, any situation that needs a Raspberry Pi to operate on batteries can be a potential use-case for this design.\nMore specifically, the following use cases were considered:\n Uninterruptable Power Supply (UPS). In cases where there is a potential power interruption, the Superpower provides backup power so the Raspberry Pi does not have an unexpected restart. Portable Pi. In cases where it is desirable to have a portable Pi or a Pi that will operate for extended periods of time using something other than \u0026ldquo;commercial power mains\u0026rdquo;, such as amateur radio Field Day competitions. This can be used to provide a computer that meets this criteria.  Potential future versions\r#\r\r Build a specific version that includes a solar MPPT IC.  github readme\n"});index.add({'id':2,'href':'/docs/uc/lowcost/schematics/','title':"Schematics",'section':"Low

It may include Notices.\n1.4 \u0026lsquo;Covered Source\u0026rsquo; means Source that is explicitly made available under this Licence.\n1.5 \u0026lsquo;Product\u0026rsquo; means any device, component, work or physical object, whether in finished or intermediate form, arising from the use, application or processing of Covered Source.\n1.6 \u0026lsquo;Make\u0026rsquo; means to create or configure something, whether by manufacture, assembly, compiling, loading or applying Covered Source or another Product or otherwise.\n1.7 \u0026lsquo;Available Component\u0026rsquo; means any part, sub-assembly, library or code which:\n a) is licensed to You as Complete Source under a Compatible\rLicence; or\rb) is available, at the time a Product or the Source containing\rit is first Conveyed, to You and any other prospective\rlicensees\ri) with sufficient rights and information (including any\rconfiguration and programming files and information\rabout its characteristics and interfaces) to enable it\reither to be Made itself, or to be sourced and used to\rMake the Product; or\rii) as part of the normal distribution of a tool used to\rdesign or Make the Product.\r 1.8 \u0026lsquo;External Material\u0026rsquo; means anything (including Source) which:\n a) is only combined with Covered Source in such a way that it\rinterfaces with the Covered Source using a documented\rinterface which is described in the Covered Source; and\rb) is not a derivative of or contains Covered Source, or, if it\ris, it is solely to the extent necessary to facilitate such\rinterfacing.\r 1.9 \u0026lsquo;Complete Source\u0026rsquo; means the set of all Source necessary to Make a Product, in the preferred form for making modifications, including necessary installation and interfacing information both for the Product, and for any included Available Components. If the format is proprietary, it must also be made available in a format (if the proprietary tool can create it) which is viewable with a tool available to potential licensees and licensed under a licence approved by the Free Software Foundation or the Open Source Initiative. Complete Source need not include the Source of any Available Component, provided that You include in the Complete Source sufficient information to enable a recipient to Make or source and use the Available Component to Make the Product.\n1.10 \u0026lsquo;Source Location\u0026rsquo; means a location where a Licensor has placed Covered Source, and which that Licensor reasonably believes will remain easily accessible for at least three years for anyone to obtain a digital copy.\n1.11 \u0026lsquo;Notice\u0026rsquo; means copyright, acknowledgement and trademark notices, Source Location references, modification notices (subsection 3.3(b)) and all notices that refer to this Licence and to the disclaimer of warranties that are included in the Covered Source.\n1.12 \u0026lsquo;Licensee\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;You\u0026rsquo; means any person exercising rights under this Licence.\n1.13 \u0026lsquo;Licensor\u0026rsquo; means a natural or legal person who creates or modifies Covered Source. A person may be a Licensee and a Licensor at the same time.\n1.14 \u0026lsquo;Convey\u0026rsquo; means to communicate to the public or distribute.\n2 Applicability\r#\r\r2.1 This Licence governs the use, copying, modification, Conveying of Covered Source and Products, and the Making of Products. By exercising any right granted under this Licence, You irrevocably accept these terms and conditions.\n2.2 This Licence is granted by the Licensor directly to You, and shall apply worldwide and without limitation in time.\n2.3 You shall not attempt to restrict by contract or otherwise the rights granted under this Licence to other Licensees.\n2.4 This Licence is not intended to restrict fair use, fair dealing, or any other similar right.\n3 Copying, Modifying and Conveying Covered Source\r#\r\r3.1 You may copy and Convey verbatim copies of Covered Source, in any medium, provided You retain all Notices.\n3.2 You may modify Covered Source, other than Notices, provided that You irrevocably undertake to make that modified Covered Source available from a Source Location should You Convey a Product in circumstances where the recipient does not otherwise receive a copy of the modified Covered Source. In each case subsection 3.3 shall apply.\n You may only delete Notices if they are no longer applicable to\rthe corresponding Covered Source as modified by You and You may\radd additional Notices applicable to Your modifications.\r 3.3 You may Convey modified Covered Source (with the effect that You shall also become a Licensor) provided that You:\n a) retain Notices as required in subsection 3.2;\rb) add a Notice to the modified Covered Source stating that You\rhave modified it, with the date and brief description of how\rYou have modified it;\rc) add a Source Location Notice for the modified Covered Source\rif You Convey in circumstances where the recipient does not\rotherwise receive a copy of the modified Covered Source; and\rd) license the modified Covered Source under the terms and\rconditions of this Licence (or, as set out in subsection\r8.3, a later version, if permitted by the licence of the\roriginal Covered Source). Such modified Covered Source must\rbe licensed as a whole, but excluding Available Components\rcontained in it or External Material to which it is\rinterfaced, which remain licensed under their own applicable\rlicences.\r 4 Making and Conveying Products\r#\r\r4.1 You may Make Products, and/or Convey them, provided that You either provide each recipient with a copy of the Complete Source or ensure that each recipient is notified of the Source Location of the Complete Source. That Complete Source includes Covered Source and You must accordingly satisfy Your obligations set out in subsection 3.3. If specified in a Notice, the Product must visibly and securely display the Source Location on it or its packaging or documentation in the manner specified in that Notice.\n4.2 Where You Convey a Product which incorporates External Material, the Complete Source for that Product which You are required to provide under subsection 4.1 need not include any Source for the External Material.\n4.3 You may license Products under terms of Your choice, provided that such terms do not restrict or attempt to restrict any recipients' rights under this Licence to the Covered Source.\n5 Research and Development\r#\r\rYou may Convey Covered Source, modified Covered Source or Products to a legal entity carrying out development, testing or quality assurance work on Your behalf provided that the work is performed on terms which prevent the entity from both using the Source or Products for its own internal purposes and Conveying the Source or Products or any modifications to them to any person other than You. Any modifications made by the entity shall be deemed to be made by You pursuant to subsection 3.2.\n6 DISCLAIMER AND LIABILITY\r#\r\r6.1 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY \u0026ndash; The Covered Source and any Products are provided \u0026lsquo;as is\u0026rsquo; and any express or implied warranties, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, of satisfactory quality, non-infringement of third party rights, and fitness for a particular purpose or use are disclaimed in respect of any Source or Product to the maximum extent permitted by law. The Licensor makes no representation that any Source or Product does not or will not infringe any patent, copyright, trade secret or other proprietary right. The entire risk as to the use, quality, and performance of any Source or Product shall be with You and not the Licensor. This disclaimer of warranty is an essential part of this Licence and a condition for the grant of any rights granted under this Licence.\n6.2 EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY \u0026ndash; The Licensor shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, have no liability for direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, exemplary, punitive or other damages of any character including, without limitation, procurement of substitute goods or services, loss of use, data or profits, or business interruption, however caused and on any theory of contract, warranty, tort (including negligence), product liability or otherwise, arising in any way in relation to the Covered Source, modified Covered Source and/or the Making or Conveyance of a Product, even if advised of the possibility of such damages, and You shall hold the Licensor(s) free and harmless from any liability, costs, damages, fees and expenses, including claims by third parties, in relation to such use.\n7 Patents\r#\r\r7.1 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Licence, each Licensor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in subsections 7.2 and 8.4) patent license to Make, have Made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Covered Source and Products, where such licence applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Licensor that are necessarily infringed by exercising rights under the Covered Source as Conveyed by that Licensor.\n7.2 If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Covered Source or a Product constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, or You seek any declaration that a patent licensed to You under this Licence is invalid or unenforceable then any rights granted to You under this Licence shall terminate as of the date such process is initiated.\n8 General\r#\r\r8.1 If any provisions of this Licence are or subsequently become invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions shall remain effective.\n8.2 You shall not use any of the name (including acronyms and abbreviations), image, or logo by which the Licensor or CERN is known, except where needed to comply with section 3, or where the use is otherwise allowed by law. Any such permitted use shall be factual and shall not be made so as to suggest any kind of endorsement or implication of involvement by the Licensor or its personnel.\n8.3 CERN may publish updated versions and variants of this Licence which it considers to be in the spirit of this version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. New versions will be published with a unique version number and a variant identifier specifying the variant. If the Licensor has specified that a given variant applies to the Covered Source without specifying a version, You may treat that Covered Source as being released under any version of the CERN-OHL with that variant. If no variant is specified, the Covered Source shall be treated as being released under CERN-OHL-S. The Licensor may also specify that the Covered Source is subject to a specific version of the CERN-OHL or any later version in which case You may apply this or any later version of CERN-OHL with the same variant identifier published by CERN.\n You may treat Covered Source licensed under CERN-OHL-W as\rlicensed under CERN-OHL-S if and only if all Available\rComponents referenced in the Covered Source comply with the\rcorresponding definition of Available Component for CERN-OHL-S.\r 8.4 This Licence shall terminate with immediate effect if You fail to comply with any of its terms and conditions.\n8.5 However, if You cease all breaches of this Licence, then Your Licence from any Licensor is reinstated unless such Licensor has terminated this Licence by giving You, while You remain in breach, a notice specifying the breach and requiring You to cure it within 30 days, and You have failed to come into compliance in all material respects by the end of the 30 day period. Should You repeat the breach after receipt of a cure notice and subsequent reinstatement, this Licence will terminate immediately and permanently. Section 6 shall continue to apply after any termination.\n8.6 This Licence shall not be enforceable except by a Licensor acting as such, and third party beneficiary rights are specifically excluded.\n"});index.add({'id':6,'href':'/docs/project/howto/','title':"Doc How to",'section':"Project",'content':"This documentation is created with hugo a static website generator\ninstall hugo\r#\r\rInstalling hugo is quite simple, as it\u0026rsquo;s a standalone binary that can be downloaded and added to the system path\n hugo getting-started : installing  clone this repo\r#\r\rNote the recusive clone to add the git submodules as well\n\u0026gt;git clone --recursive https://github.com/Informaticore/SuperPower\r\u0026gt;cd SuperPower\r\u0026gt;cd website_work_dir\r test locally\r#\r\rno generation is required to test locally, hugo takes care of generating and serving\n\u0026gt;hugo server\r deploy\r#\r\rgenerate the website in the public folder\n\u0026gt;hugo\r make sure you commit and push the public submodule before the top repo\ndoc maintainer\r#\r\rPlease contact the documentation maintainer wassfila\n for questions or issues related to how to use or contribute to the documentation you notice any typo or error that you\u0026rsquo;d like simply to help by notifying without having to create a ticket  "});index.add({'id':7,'href':'/docs/uc/requirements/','title':"Requirements",'section':"ESP32 SOLAR \"APPOLO\"",'content':"Requirements\r#\r\rFull screen\rOpen in a new page\r\r\r\r\rvar button = document.getElementById(\"btn-c1faa48d69c2c798\");\rbutton.onclick = ()={\rvar elem = document.getElementById(\"ifm-c1faa48d69c2c798\");\rif (elem.requestFullscreen) {\relem.requestFullscreen();\r} else if (elem.webkitRequestFullscreen) { elem.webkitRequestFullscreen();\r} else if (elem.msRequestFullscreen) { elem.msRequestFullscreen();\r}\r};\r\r"});index.add({'id':8,'href':'/docs/uc/workflow/','title':"Workflow",'section':"ESP32 SOLAR \"APPOLO\"",'content':"Branching and Pull-Requests\r#\r\r The master is the single point of truth and the latest version of the board.
